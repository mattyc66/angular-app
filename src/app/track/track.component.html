      <h2 class="title">The Idea</h2>
      <p>
        This project focused on addressing the challenges in animal safety and monitoring by leveraging advancements in GPS technology. 
        The project highlights the development of a robust animal tracking system designed to improve safety, efficiency, and innovation across various use cases,
        including wildlife conservation, livestock management, and pet care.
        Key motivations for this project include preventing animals from straying into dangerous areas, ensuring real-time updates on their movements, and 
        responding swiftly to emergencies. By integrating GPS technology, the proposed system aims to deliver cost-effective and precise solutions 
        tailored to different environments.
        With GPS enabling wide-area location tracking and affordable solutions for confined spaces, this system is envisioned as a 
        multi-purpose tool for users who prioritize animal safety and health. It stands to transform how we monitor, protect, and care for animals in 
        diverse scenarios.

    <h2 class="title">Proposed Solution</h2>
    <p>
      The project aims to develop a GPS-based animal tracking system equipped with advanced features to ensure real-time monitoring and timely alerts. 
      The system is designed with the following capabilities:
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      <strong>GPS Boundaries and Real-Time Tracking</strong> <br>
      Users can set GPS boundaries, ensuring animals remain within secure areas. Real-time location updates provide crucial insights, particularly 
      during emergencies.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      <strong>Boundary Breach and Inactivity Alerts</strong> <br>
      The system detects boundary breaches and monitors animal inactivity, enabling users to respond promptly to potential dangers or health concerns.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      <strong>Offline Functionality</strong> <br>
      A mechanism to track animals when the system is offline by displaying the last known location ensures continuous safety monitoring, even in areas with 
      limited connectivity.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      <strong>Customizable Applications</strong> <br>
      Designed to cater to various scenarios, the system can be adapted for wildlife, livestock, or domestic pets, allowing users to customize settings 
      based on their specific needs.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      <Strong>Lightweight and Durable Design</Strong> <br>
      The proposed tracker combines durability with a user-friendly interface, ensuring it is practical for extended use across different environments.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      By achieving these objectives, the project seeks to address gaps in current animal tracking technologies and provide a comprehensive solution for 
      safeguarding animals across diverse contexts.

    <h2 class="title">Final System Development and Functionality</h2>
    <br>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Hardware used</h2>
    <p>
      The system’s hardware included an ESP32 microcontroller, a NEO-6M GPS module, a power bank, and an optional OLED LCD display for testing purposes. 
      The ESP32 was chosen over an Arduino for its built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, eliminating the need for additional modules. 
      The NEO-6M GPS module provided reliable location data with an accuracy of around 2.5 meters. The power bank supplied portable power, 
      while the OLED display showed real-time GPS coordinates and satellite data during development, though it wasn’t essential for the final product
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Software</h2>
    <p>
      Development was carried out in Visual Studio Code with the PlatformIO extension. This combination offered advanced features like autocompletion, 
      debugging tools, and GitHub integration, streamlining the coding process. The system was programmed in C++ and used the MQTT protocol for data 
      communication. It connected to the HiveMQ public MQTT broker via Wi-Fi, transmitting live GPS data, including latitude, longitude, and satellite 
      count, to specific topics accessible to users.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Hardware and Software Intergration</h2>
    <p>
      The ESP32 microcontroller acted as the core component, managing both the GPS module and the Wi-Fi connection. It continuously collected GPS data and transmitted 
      it to the MQTT broker, ensuring real-time updates. The OLED display, used during testing, provided a quick way to verify that the GPS module was 
      functioning without relying on external software. The seamless integration between hardware and software allowed for a reliable, efficient system 
      capable of real-time communication.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Features</h2>
    <p>The system offered several key features to ensure usability and adaptability: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Boundary System: </strong>Users could draw custom boundaries directly on a map instead of inputting GPS coordinates manually. If the tracker moved outside the set boundaries, an alert was triggered.</li> <br>
      <li><strong>User Interface: </strong>A web application built with React and hosted on AWS Amplify provided real-time GPS data and a live map showing the tracker’s location. The app was designed to be fully responsive, allowing access on both desktop and mobile devices.</li> <br>
      <li><strong>Live Tracking: </strong>The app displayed the tracker’s location in real time, with data continuously updating via MQTT. The satellite count was also visualized to indicate connection strength.</li> <br>
      <li><strong>Custom Alerts: </strong>Notifications were sent when the tracker left a designated boundary, ensuring prompt awareness of potential issues.</li> <br>
    </ul>
